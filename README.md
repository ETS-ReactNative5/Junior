# Junior

## Description

---

Junior is a full-stack web application that helps junior developers find jobs for their skill-level, find gigs in order to boost their resume, and to easily showcase a portfolio of their projects.

Junior also allows employers to post jobs and gig work for developers to pick up.

Junior uses a REST api backend with Express.js, PostgresSQL, and Twilio.

The frontend was built with React, React Router, SASS, and MaterialUI (MUI).
